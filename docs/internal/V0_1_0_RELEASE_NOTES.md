# AgentOS v0.1.0 Release Notes

## 🎉 Emergent Multi-Agent Behavior is Here!

**Release Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Production Ready  
**Codename**: "Emergent Intelligence"

---

## 🚀 Major Features

### 1. Emergent Agency System

AgentOS can now **dynamically decompose complex goals**, **spawn adaptive roles**, and **coordinate multiple agents** in real-time.

**Key Capabilities:**
- ✅ Goal decomposition into subtasks with dependency tracking
- ✅ Adaptive role spawning based on task requirements
- ✅ Parallel execution with automatic error recovery
- ✅ Inter-agent coordination through shared context
- ✅ Structured output formatting (Markdown, JSON, CSV, Text)
- ✅ Full state persistence and replay

**Documentation**: [EMERGENT_AGENCY_SYSTEM.md](./EMERGENT_AGENCY_SYSTEM.md)

---

### 2. Tool Execution Bridge

Unified tool execution pipeline with schema validation:

- ✅ Backend `/api/agentos/tools/execute` → AgentOS ToolOrchestrator
- ✅ Input validation via AJV against JSON schemas
- ✅ Output validation for type safety
- ✅ Registry-based tool discovery from `@framers/agentos-extensions`

**Example:**
```typescript
POST /api/agentos/tools/execute
{
  "toolId": "webSearch",
  "input": { "query": "quantum computing 2024" },
  "userId": "user123"
}
```

---

### 3. Verified Extensions Program

Administrative framework for curating high-quality extensions:

- ✅ Verification policy documented in [EXTENSIONS_VERIFICATION.md](./EXTENSIONS_VERIFICATION.md)
- ✅ Standards for tests, docs, security practices
- ✅ Verified badge displayed in Extension Manager UI
- ✅ Metadata tracked in registry (`verified`, `verifiedAt`, `verificationChecklistVersion`)

---

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation

- ✅ OpenAPI spec served at `https://agentos.sh/docs/api`
- ✅ Linked in site header for easy discovery
- ✅ All READMEs updated with consistent branding
- ✅ Verified Program blurbs in extensions/guardrails docs
