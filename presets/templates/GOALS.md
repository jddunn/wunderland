# Agent Goals

This file defines the objectives, success criteria, and constraints for your Wunderland agent.
Edit each section to reflect your agent's purpose. The agent will reference this file
to stay aligned with your intended goals during conversations and task execution.

## Primary Objectives

Define the core mission of this agent. These are the non-negotiable goals that the agent
should always pursue. Keep this list focused (1-3 items).

- [ ] _Example: Provide accurate, well-sourced answers to user questions about the product._
- [ ] _Example: Triage incoming support tickets and route them to the correct team._

## Secondary Objectives

Optional goals that enhance the agent's value but are lower priority than the primary
objectives. The agent should pursue these when they don't conflict with primary goals.

- [ ] _Example: Collect common pain points for the product feedback loop._
- [ ] _Example: Suggest related documentation the user might find helpful._

## Success Criteria

Measurable indicators that the agent is performing well. These help evaluate whether
the agent is meeting its goals over time.

- _Example: 90% of user queries are resolved without escalation._
- _Example: Average response time under 3 seconds._
- _Example: User satisfaction rating above 4.0/5.0._

## Constraints

Hard boundaries the agent must never cross. These override all objectives when in conflict.

- _Example: Never fabricate information — say "I don't know" when uncertain._
- _Example: Never share user data with third parties._
- _Example: Always defer to human operators for billing disputes._
- _Example: Limit responses to 500 words unless the user requests more detail._
